<aside class="notes">
  We can provide some simple visualization techniques to make the life of the GIS operator a little easier. One of them is called the heatmap. In this technique, each point contributes with a color spectrum to the output. More specifically, points in proximity of each other will produce a stronger color so they're easier to see in the map.
