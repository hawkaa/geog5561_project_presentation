<p>Maximize profit and minimize risk in the process of finding new customers for Internet Service Providers (ISP)</p>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>The project's goal is to use a geographical information system to maximize profit and minimize risk in the process of finding new customers for an internet service provider. </p>
  <p>By an internet service provider I mean a company that supplies high speed broadband connections to households and businesses, the companies responsible for connecting their cables to your house so you can enjoy netflix, spotify and facebook.</p>

  <p>I'm going to use ISP instead of Internet service provider for most the presentation, so please remember what this is</p>
