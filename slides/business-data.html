<p>US Business Locations and Business Summary<br />database from Esri</p>

<aside class="notes">
  Since we look into businesses as well, we're interested in the physical location of these. Esri sells a data set they call US Business Locations And Business Summary which we can use in this application. In contrast to the parcel data, this data set includes relevant attributes like the annual sales and number of employees.
