<p>So here's a little about the motivation of the project. First of all, Bell Labs have forcasted an increase of internet traffic demand by 3.7 times from 2012 to 2017, where nearly all of it is forecasted to come from fixed internet connections, like the ones the ISPs supply.</p>
<p>Secondly, my research shows there are over 30 internet service providers in the united states, resulting in a highly competitive market with low margins of profit</p>
<p>In other words, there should be plenty of customers out there requesting newer technology and faster internet connections </p>
