<aside class="notes">
  The next thing we want to filter is households to far away from the existing network infrastructure. To help us do this, we can make use of another old friend of ours, namely the buffer. By drawing a buffer around the existing network, one can use the intersect operator to hide all households outside this buffer polygon. The GIS operator will be provided with yet another to adjust the buffer polygon sizes.
