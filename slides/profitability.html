  Customer potential is not the only thing that should be taken into account. According to a paper published by Weldon and Zane on ISP economics, the population density of the area will affect the cost, that is one should prefer areas where customers are cluster together. Additionally, digging down the cables is also very costly, so the new customers should be close to already existing network infrastructure. Needless to say, the ISP should also avoid areas with many competitors.
