<p>Median household income from the United States Census Bureau, divided by census tracts.</p>
<aside class="notes">
  Since we need relevant attributes about the households, I went to the US Census webpage. Here, you can download data including:
  <ul>
    <li>Average income</li>
    <li>Average number of children </li>
    <li>Average age</li>
    <li>High school diploma</li>
  </ul>
  ETCETERA. However, they only sample a fraction of the population, and are required to consevre anonymity, their data (as you can see) is divided into census tracts. These data are free.
